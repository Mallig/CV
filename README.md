## Malachy Gilchrist

I am a full-stack developer recently passed through Makers software development bootcamp, before which I was studying Mechanical Engineeering at Heriot Watt University where I recieved a bachelors degree. I enjoy learning and am exited for the unkowns working as a software developer will expose me to, I'm looking for somewhere offering opportunities to learn and encouraging self learning. I'm currently focused on understanding how to present quantitative information in forms that engage the viewer, encouraging them to ask questions. I hope to be able to build interfaces around these displays which enable the viewer to have those questions answered and give rise to new questions. This intentionally sounds like the dynamic between teacher and student, however in a classroom the feedback loop between question and answer is much tighter.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

The opportunity for problem solving was a big part of what attracted me to an Engineering degree, and again when deciding to go into software development. Throughout my childhood I spent many days fixing old cars with very little in the way of electronics and no software involved, diagnosing faults was a case of understanding and moving through the system until the culprit is found. I have a very analytical mind which was well suited for studying engineering during which I had to use environmental data for an island to create a renewable energy plan to power the island throughout the year. Last year I participated in a hackathon organised to solve problems present in the rail industry, our team was tasked with creating a visualisation for train information around the country. 

#### Personable

I am a very easygoing and open minded person, I always try and make time for others when they need help. I understand when working with others that they have a different perspective to me, not being able to communicate or accept these perspectives limits your output as a team to what you can agree on. I enjoy working with others as it's an opportunity to see from their perspective, widening my own in the process. I've really enjoyed pair programming while at Makers, other students found pairing with me an enjoyable experience and I have been told I have a very patient demeanor suited to teaching. During my gap year I spent some time working at a safari where I accompanied guests on some of their outings.

## Projects

|Project|Summary|Tech|Time|
|-------|-------|----|----|
|[Trick Or Eat Brains](https://github.com/Lucx14/zombie-infection)| Final project at Makers, created as part of a team of four. We had a lot of fun making this game and were suprised at what we could acheive with only Javascript and an HTML canvas. [Have a play](http://trick-or-eat-brains.herokuapp.com/).| React, JavaScript, HTML | 2 Weeks |
|[Acebook](https://github.com/ChocolatineMathou/acebook-PushMePullYou)| Ruby on Rails app mimicking Facebook, styled to look like an RSpec test. [Hosted on Heroku](http://acebook-pushmepullyou.herokuapp.com/posts)| Ruby on Rails | 2 Weeks |
|[Boris Bikes](https://github.com/Mallig/boris_bikes)| First week project at Makers, learned some of the SOLID design principles, how to TDD, and practiced pair programming. | Ruby, RSpec | 1 Week |
|[WhatsApp Clone](https://github.com/Mallig/whatsapp)| Clone of WhatsApp, an ongoing learning exercise in full stack development. This front end is currently utilising two APIs ([Ruby](https://github.com/Mallig/whatsapp-users), [Python](https://github.com/Mallig/conversations-python))| React, CircleCI | Ongoing |
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Mallig/bank-tech-test)| Practice Tech Test, simulates a bank in the JavaScript console. Users can deposit, withdraw and see the statement for their account | Javascript, Jasmine | 2 Days |


## Education

#### Makers Academy (August -> October 2018)

12 week intensive full stack coding bootcamp focused on teaching SOLID design principles and TDD through OOP.

- Curious and passionate about code. I first started learning to code before university, distracted by uni work I didn't pick it up again until halfway through the course when we were introduced to Visual Basic. There was only a small amount of coding taught for one semester and I found myself wanting to learn more, realising that a lot of the problems being presented were easier to solve if I looked past the course syllabus.
- The fast paced learning was perfect for me as I can often lock myself into learning a new thing fully before moving on. 
- I really enjoyed pair programming while at makers and found the opportunity to see how others work to be invaluable in improving my own process. 

    - OOP, TDD, MVC, BDD
    - Agile/XP
    - Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
    - RSpec, Jasmine

#### Heriot-Watt University (September 2012 -> July 2018)

- Mechanical Engineering. 
- BEng

#### Bryanston School

- A levels in Maths, Physics and Biology (BBB)
- Participated in rowing and cross-country events

## Experience

Veedon Fleece 2009~2019

- One month working at Tiger Tops Safari, work varying from teaching at the local school to harvesting and making food for elephants

## Interests

Video Games, not only to play but as a medium through which to tell a story, or impart lessons on an audience. 

Music, I played the saxophone at school and have been teaching myself to play the keyboard. I'm more interested in music as a tool to evoke emotion, and how this could be utilised when creating interactive software. How can music, or even just sounds, help the user understand a situation? 

Gardening, I enjoy working with my hands and am fascinated by whats the natural world has to offer.
